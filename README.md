# unphased

My first exploratory project into live multiplayer games.

Pulled ideas from different side scrollers to make a co-op version where one player is allowed to phase through some blocks so the duo can complete the level together. 

Uses socket.io to create rooms for different pairs, and to sync up the two players. 

Currently a heavy work in progress.
